# Week 4 Assignment: AI in Software Engineering  
### Theme: **Building Intelligent Software Solutions** üíªü§ñ

---

## üéØ Objective

This assignment evaluates your understanding of AI applications in software engineering through:

- **Theoretical Analysis**  
- **Practical Implementation**  
- **Ethical Reflection**

You will demonstrate how AI can **automate tasks**, **enhance decision-making**, and **address challenges** in software development.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Resources

- **AI Tools:** GitHub Copilot, Testim.io, Google Colab  
- **Datasets:** Kaggle, GitHub Issues  
- **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, Selenium

---

## üìö Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Short Answer Questions

- **Q1:** Explain how AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?  
- **Q2:** Compare supervised and unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.  
- **Q3:** Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Case Study Analysis

- **Article:** *AI in DevOps: Automating Deployment Pipelines*  
- **Question:** How does AIOps improve software deployment efficiency? Provide two examples.

## üíª Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)

### Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

- **Tool:** GitHub Copilot or Tabnine  
- **Task:**  
  - Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.  
  - Compare the AI-suggested code with your manual implementation.  
  - Document which version is more efficient and why.  
- **Deliverable:** Code snippets + 200-word analysis.

---

### Task 2: Automated Testing with AI

- **Framework:** Selenium IDE with AI plugins or Testim.io  
- **Task:**  
  - Automate a test case for a login page (valid/invalid credentials).  
  - Run the test and capture results (success/failure rates).  
  - Explain how AI improves test coverage compared to manual testing.  
- **Deliverable:** Test script + screenshot of results + 150-word summary.

---

### Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation

- **Dataset:** Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset  
- **Goal:**  
  - Preprocess data (clean, label, split).  
  - Train a model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict issue priority (high/medium/low).  
  - Evaluate using accuracy and F1-score.  
- **Deliverable:** Jupyter Notebook + performance metrics.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)

- **Prompt:** Your predictive model from Task 3 is deployed in a company. Discuss:  
  - Potential biases in the dataset (e.g., underrepresented teams).  
  - How fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 could address these biases.

---

## üöÄ Bonus Task (Extra 10%)

**Innovation Challenge:** Propose an AI tool to solve a software engineering problem not covered in class (e.g., automated documentation generation).

- **Deliverable:** 1-page proposal outlining the tool‚Äôs purpose, workflow, and impact.
